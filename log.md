# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 23rd 2022 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Completed hackerrank's list comprehension's challenge

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with having to figure out how and why the zip() function was not quite the answer to tackling the problem at hand.

### Day 1: May 24, 2022
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a beginner project: the Mad Libs generator.

**Thoughts**: I feel really great having worked well to request and manipulate user input, work around with some strings and escape sequences and even use up a few control flow organisations structures.

### Day 2: May 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've actually put quite a few hours on a guess the number game

**Thoughts** I feel really kinda excited to actually work on more than 100 lines of code. I however feel a bit lacking in terms of how to, say, exit a nested if loop and hopefully I can get a grasp of the concept soon enough. Regardless, I feel niceee!

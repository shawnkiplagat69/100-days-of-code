**Today's Progress**: Completed hackerrank's list comprehension's challenge

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with having to figure out how and why the zip() function was not quite the answer to tackling the problem at hand.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a beginner project: the Mad Libs generator.

**Thoughts**: I feel really great having worked well to request and manipulate user input, work around with some strings and escape sequences and even use up a few control flow organisations structures.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
